            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Armaan Chahal, a passionate and detail-oriented 3rd year Computer Science student at SFU with a strong focus on 
                back-end development and practical problem-solving. 
                I enjoy building efficient software solutions, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming and database management.

                I have hands-on experience working with technologies like Directus and SvelteKit through my role as 
                a back-end developer at CJSF Radio. My projects reflect my ability to write clean, maintainable code 
                following best practices, ensuring both functionality and user experience.</p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>I volunteered to teach Science at my university to my peers. I was selected on the basis of my grades. 
                I tutored Calculus 1 for 8 months, having scored an A in both calculus 1 and 2. I also tutored chemistry 
                for 4 months having scored an A in that as well. I applied for physics tutoring as well having scored an A+ and 
                a research position proposal which I formally declined as that was not the area I wanted to focus on.</p>

        <div class="Work">
            <h2>Back-End Developer - CJSF Radio</h2>
            <p>At CJSF, I manage and enhance the backend infrastructure using Directus to create, maintain, and streamline data 
                workflows. I collaborate with the team to design scalable APIs, improve system performance, and integrate content 
                management features for the radio station's website. I also ensure smooth interaction with the SvelteKit frontend, 
                enabling seamless content delivery and user experience. My role involves identifying bottlenecks, troubleshooting 
                backend issues, and contributing to the continuous development of tools and features tailored to CJSF's operational needs.</p>
